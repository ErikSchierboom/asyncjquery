    <h1>Asynchronous jQuery example</h1>

    <p>
        Asynchronous programming is becoming more and more important. However, not everyone is aware of the fact that <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/" title="Asycnchronous programming in jQuery">jQuery has had asynchronous support since version 1.5</a>. 
        This sample shows how to do asynchronous programming in jQuery using existing asynchronous methods and also how to create your own asynchronous methods.
    </p>

    <h2>Example 1: asynchronous script retrieval</h2>

    <button id="example1">Example 1</button>

    <h2>Example 2: multiple asynchronous scripts retrieval</h2>

    <button id="example2">Example 2</button>

    <h2>Example 3: custom asynchronous function</h2>

    <button id="example3">Example 3</button>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
        // This example shows the most basic example of asynchronous methods. It calls $.getJSON, which
        // returns a Deferred object. Deferred objects have a done() method that is called when the Deferred
        // object has finished.
        function example1() {
            $.getJSON('Data/example1.json').done(function (content1) {
                alert('Data retrieved from example1.json: ' + content1);
            });
        };

        // This example waits for two asynchronous methods to finish before calling the done method.
        // We use the $.when method for this purposes, which is basically a simple way to wrap
        // one or more Deferred objects into a single, new Deferred objects. This is especially convenient
        // when we want to wait for several Deferred objects to finish their before doing something.
        // In the example below, we use $.when to create a Deferred object which done method is only
        // called when both $.getJSON calls are done
        function example2() {
            $.when($.getJSON('Data/example2.json'), $.getJSON('Data/example3.json')).done(function (content2, content3) {
                alert('Data retrieved from example2.json: ' + content2[0]);
                alert('Data retrieved from example3.json: ' + content3[0]);
            });
        };

        // This example waits for two asynchronous methods to finish before calling the done method.
        // We use the $.when method for this purposes, which is basically a simple way to wrap
        // one or more Deferred objects into a single, new Deferred objects. This is especially convenient

        // In the example below, we use $.when to create a Deferred object which done method is only

        function example3() {

            // Create the deferred object
            var deferred = $.Deferred();

            // Set the timeout for 1 seconds and when the timeout occurs, we call the
            // resolve() method of the deferred object. The resolve() method changes the
            // state of the deferred object to done, which means that it's done() method
            // is then called.
            setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 1000);

            // We wait for the deferred object to get in the done state
            $.when(deferred).done(function () {
                alert('timeout passed for example 3');
            });
        };

        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Bind the event handlers to their corresponding functions
            $('#example1').on('click', example1);
            $('#example2').on('click', example2);
            $('#example3').on('click', example3);
